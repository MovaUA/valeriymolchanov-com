profile:
  - I fell in love with coding back in my childhood.
  - Almost my entire professional carrier, for more than 15 years, I write different types of applications with C#. Then I discovered a whole new world of Kubernetes and DevOps, that was a great pleasure to master such complex technologies.
  - My constant desire to dig deeper opened me GO, which amazed me with its simplicity, speed, and powerful concurrency model, thus in my spare time, I code and experiment with this beautiful language together with my son.
  - Mostly I do back-end stuff, which you can not see except for the logs and metrics, and the other day I wanted to see and touch what I do, so I learned Angular, TypeScript, Ngrx, and Nodejs.
